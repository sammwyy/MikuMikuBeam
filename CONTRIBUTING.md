- Have carefully **READ** the entirely [Setup](https://github.com/sammwyy/MikuMikuBeam?tab=readme-ov-file#setup-%EF%B8%8F) and [Installation](https://github.com/sammwyy/MikuMikuBeam?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-)?
- open the terminal or command prompt in your Miku folder? (psst, clone or download the repo first and then enter it)
- Have Node.js (v14 or above) and npm installed onto your pc (or server?) first?
- run `git pull` # to be in the latest version.
- Make `proxies.txt` amd `uas.txt` if it doesn't exist in the data folder. (if it does exist then ignore this part.)
- run `npm install` in the terminal (im assuming you are useing ubuntu, or windows terminal....)
- and then run `npm run dev` to start the server!
- then go to [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/)
and it should look like this! (Im useing Dark reader but you will see the same thing. The "active bots" number will be diffrent for each user)
