# Contributing to MikuMikuBeam!

Welcome! before you start making an issue. Did you first 

- Have carefully **READ** the [Setup](https://github.com/sammwyy/MikuMikuBeam?tab=readme-ov-file#setup-%EF%B8%8F) and [Installation](https://github.com/sammwyy/MikuMikuBeam?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-) before?
- open the terminal or command prompt in your Miku folder? (clone or download the repo first and then enter it)
- Have Node.js (v14 or above) and npm installed onto your pc or on your linux server first.
- run `git pull` # to be in the latest version.
- Make `proxies.txt` and `uas.txt` if it doesn't exist in the data folder. (if it does exist then ignore this part.)
- run `npm install` in the same terminal (Im assuming that you are using ubuntu, or windows terminal..)
- and then run `npm run dev` to start the server!
- then go to [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/) and at last, it should show like this. (If it doesn't show up, you broke or forgot to install something.)
